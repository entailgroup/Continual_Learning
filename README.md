# Continual_Learning
Continual Learning is a concept to learn a model for a large number of tasks sequentially without forgetting knowledge obtained from the preceding tasks, where the data in the old tasks are not available anymore during training new ones.  In this project, we aim to implement state-of-the-art methods of continual learning with a focus on regression tasks.
